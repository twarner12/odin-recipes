        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>quarter of a cup salted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2.5 cups milk, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>half of a cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
            <li>To make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gradually whisk 2 Â½ cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed.</li>
            <li>Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
            <li>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned.</li>
            <li>Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
